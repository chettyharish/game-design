game-design
===========

This is my game developed using blender 2.7. The models are partially from blendswap and partially edited/modifed by me. 
Most of the game works using Python 3.4.1 and was created by me. Please feel free to use them if you need it.
I have used a lot of blends from blendswap.com and textures from google images.
Thanks to Freesound.org for the game sounds.
